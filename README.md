# Number-Recognition
Implementation of Neural Networks on MNIST dataset using python3

I just finished stanford's university machine learning course on coursera. The exercises were matlab 
and althought i liked the language i didn't think it was suited to marketplalace. So i decided that i would
implement what i learned in a more markatable language. In this case, python. 

This is my first repository commited to github, so i am still a noob in this git universe. If i made any silly mistake
please don't get irritated. :)
